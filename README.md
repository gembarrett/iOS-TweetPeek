iOS-TweetPeek
=============

Using Twitter API and JSON to create Twitter Feed iOS app.

Developed in February 2012 while on app development course taught by Aral Balkan.

This code was developed prior to the release of XCode 4.4 and iOS 6, so a handful of errors and warnings now occur. These will be addressed in future updates.
